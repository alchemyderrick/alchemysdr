# Data APIs Overview

> Use Alchemy Data to build and scale your business

The Data APIs give you fast, reliable access to blockchain data without running your own indexing infrastructure.

## When Should I Use the Data APIs?

Use the Data APIs if:

* You need pre-indexed blockchain data without running your own nodes or infrastructure.
* You want to read user portfolios, token balances, transfer history, or NFT data.
* You're sending transactions and **not** using Alchemy's Smart Wallets.
  * If you are using our wallets, check out the Wallet APIs, which supports:
    * `sendUserOp`
    * `estimateUserOpGas`
    * and more account abstraction features
* You want to simulate or estimate transaction outcomes before sending them.
* You need to track wallet or contract activity with push notifications via Webhooks.

## Data APIs Use Cases

### 1. Developer Tooling & Debugging

Perfect for advanced dev environments, simulation dashboards, and infra teams.

* Use endpoints like:
  * `debug_traceTransaction`
  * `debug_getRawTrace`

### 2. Help Users *Write* Transactions

Ideal for apps that generate transactions on behalf of users.

**Common use cases:**

* ERC-20 swaps
* NFT purchases and listings
* Wallets that send tokens or interact with contracts
* Portfolio apps that need to simulate or batch transactions

### 3. Help Users *Read* Transactions

**Common use cases:**

* Wallets and portfolio trackers

* Token/NFT ownership queries

* Historical transfers and analytics dashboards

* Price feeds and on-chain trends

* Pre-indexed data to power all your frontend and backend logic

* Use endpoints like:
  * `getNftsForOwner` - Retrieves all NFTs currently owned by a specified address.
  * `alchemy_getTokenBalances` - Returns ERC-20 token balances for a given address.
  * `alchemy_getAssetTransfers` - Fetches historical transactions for any address across Ethereum and supported L2s including Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism.
