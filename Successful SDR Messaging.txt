Successful Messaging:

1. hey team! noticing a pretty big increase in usage this month


curious if all of your infra is on alchemy? would love to see how we can help consolidate!


i know we were also chatting about gasless txn's previously, happy to continue the convo there as well


2. wanted to mention Alchemy recently announced our new Transaction Engine, enabling gasless transactions + txn bundling through EIP-7702 (we actually power 70% of ALL bundled UserOps across all of EVM!)

3. Hey Chuck! I know Dexari is mostly on Hypercore currently, curious if you guys are expanding more into HyperEVM in the near future?


we recently shipped our first full infra revamp improving latency by up to 5x for teams like Opensea, Phantom, Uniswap, etc.


would love to chat with your team to learn more about what your current infra setup looks like

4. we been working with Phygitals, CollectorCrypt, Phantom, etc. on trials and seen improvements of up to 5x in terms of latency


Would you be open to a 24h trial (free CU's) with us to see what we've built out?


benchmarks here: https://alchemyinsights.grafana.net/public-dashboards/2e1b5ccc97dd4e438dc4e5c6bba29781

5. For context:


Alchemy is the leading infra provider across the Web3 space — currently powering infrastructure for over 70% of the top EVM dapps including Opensea, Uniswap, Phantom, etc.


We recently shipped our first full infra revamp improving latency by up to 5x for teams like Opensea, Phantom, Uniswap, etc. and I'd love to chat over what your current infra setup looks like!

6. hm gotcha, i'd love to jump on a call with one of my solutions engineers to
diagnose the usage increase here
typically we should be cheaper than running your own node especially if
you're providing global support

we have bare metal servers in data centers across the world to ensure the
lowest latency

depending on your usage, we'd most likely be able to give
credits+decreased rates as well
 
Solana Messaging:

1. we actually completely revamped our Solana architecture recently and acquired Dexter Lab, making us the leader in archival data in the space


we actually helped teams increase user transactions increase by up to 5x on some Solana dapps, dont want to take up too much of your time, but would love to show a demo here




just touching base again as we've been partnering with teams like Opensea, Phantom, and Phygitals in trialing our new Solana offering where our benchmarks have proved to be the most performant amongst competitors


happy to chat moreover what this looks like for Definitive early next week 🙂



I noticed your usage has gone up pretty massively this month on Alchemy
and would love to learn more about what you're building today 

Happy to also trade some notes on how we can improve your latency and
potentially provide cheaper rates depending on your overall usage

Let me know if you'd be free for a quick 15 min call next week!

1. Latency
Hey xyz!
[Line on what they're doing in DeFi - that ties in the message]
We recently announced Cortex and been working with top DeFi teams (Aave, Uniswap, Polymarket) to help them improve latency by up to 5x—making Alchemy the fastest across every chain. With our revamped architecture - faster data = snappier trading, less slippage/MEV.
Open to a quick chat on how we can help your team cut latency by up to 5x?

2. Follow Up (Polymarket)
Don't just take it from us, we've started to transition our top partners to our new infra - check out early feedback from Polymarket as they've seen 3x reduced latency and users were experiencing a 2.5x improvement in transaction speed!

Let's look to book some time next week! :)

3. Throughput
Excited to follow up as we continue to make improvements on our side — our new architecture now reaches up to 90k RPS with no change in error rate.
At Alchemy, we know high throughput and low latency are key during volatile events. Our goal is to remove the stress of scaling infra, while helping you capitalize during these key scaling events.
Free to chat this week on how we can help you scale?

4. Multi-region
Not sure if you're aware, our revamped infra now has improved multi-region support, serving users across the globe while keeping speeds consistently fast regardless of location!
Round-trip times have now reduced, improving responsiveness for both bots and human traders. Running nodes, relays, and APIs in multiple regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia) brings infrastructure physically closer to:
* Validators and sequencers submitting transactions
* End-users interacting with dApps
* Oracles publishing data
One of the largest wallet teams in all of web3 reported >10x faster P50s due to our revamped infra.
Happy to sync and take a look at how your setup's handling global traffic lately!

5. Reliability
99.9% reliability is simply not enough and at Alchemy, we understand this.
Our infra now auto-detects issues and redirects requests in real time to keep things running smoothly. If a region experiences an outage or degradation, traffic automatically shifts to a healthy region, preserving both performance and data integrity.
Let's find time this week to see how we can improve reliability and remove the need for multiple providers as backups :)

6. Chains
Hey name, noticed you guys are currently on 5 chains over at XXX!
Over the past year, Alchemy has went from 5-80 chains supported across the platform. The idea is to simplify multi-chain development: one integration gets you access to dozens of networks, with consistent tooling across the board.
As teams juggle deployments across L1s and L2s, extended chain support leads to easier liquidity expansion, less overhead managing different environments.
Let me know if it makes sense to walk through your plans for chain support and what Alchemy supports today

7. Wrap-up
Hey team, wanted to check in here as things are moving along on your side!
We're working closely with a handful of high-growth teams in DeFi right now, helping them scale infra as they enter new markets, launch new products, or prep for more volume.
If you're thinking about what the next 6–12 months looks like from an infra lens — happy to connect and see if there's a fit to go deeper together.
No pressure at all, just wanted to get this on your radar as we've seen these convos open up a lot of value when timed right
