Whether you’re building wallets, NFT platforms, analytics dashboards, or DeFi apps, the Data APIs save you time and engineering costs by offering pre-transformed, production-ready data. Components of the Data APIs Portfolio API Build a complete portfolio view of a user’s wallet, across tokens and NFTs. Token API Easily request information about specific tokens like metadata or wallet balances. Transfers API Fetch historical transactions for any address in one request. Prices API Access real-time and historical prices for tokens. NFT API Instantly find, verify, and display any NFT, across all major blockchains. Webhooks Subscribe to on-chain events like transfers, transactions, and balance changes. Simulation API Simulate a transaction and see its potential effects before you send it. Utility API Enhanced APIs to get blocks by timestamp and transaction receipts. When Should I Use the Data APIs? Use the Data APIs if: You need pre-indexed blockchain data without running your own nodes or infrastructure. You want to read user portfolios, token balances, transfer history, or NFT data. You’re sending transactions and not using Alchemy’s Smart Wallets. If you are using our wallets, check out the Wallet APIs, which supports: sendUserOp estimateUserOpGas and more account abstraction features You want to simulate or estimate transaction outcomes before sending them. You need to track wallet or contract activity with push notifications via Webhooks. Data APIs Use Cases 1. Developer Tooling &amp; Debugging Perfect for advanced dev environments, simulation dashboards, and infra teams. Use endpoints like: debug_traceTransaction debug_getRawTrace 2. Help Users Write Transactions Ideal for apps that generate transactions on behalf of users. Common use cases: ERC-20 swaps NFT purchases and listings Wallets that send tokens or interact with contracts Portfolio apps that need to simulate or batch transactions 3. Help Users Read Transactions Common use cases: Wallets and portfolio trackers Token/NFT ownership queries Historical transfers and analytics dashboards Price feeds and on-chain trends Pre-indexed data to power all your frontend and backend logic Use endpoints like: getNftsForOwner - Retrieves all NFTs currently owned by a specified address. alchemy_getTokenBalances - Returns ERC-20 token balances for a given address. alchemy_getAssetTransfers - Fetches historical transactions for any address across Ethereum and supported L2s including Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism.
